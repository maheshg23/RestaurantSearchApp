But in a few minutes, as we were about to dig into our soup, the place was bustling with people waiting outside. So, what’s the fuss all about? It’s the old world feel. It gives you a feeling that it’s been there since ages with a tribe of loyal customers. It’s like nothing has changed and that’s what people love about it. It isn’t cheap by any standards but I guess it’s a great place to grab a beer and munch on an appetiser. A big bottle of Kingfisher is for 300/- . Food: well, it’s nothing special but you can’t fault it. And that’s what brings people back here. You just can’t go wrong. They offer an array of Chinese and Japanese dishes. Some indian dishes quietly slipped in like Gobi Manchurian 😜 I tried the corn and asparagus soup, the chilly baby corn, aromatic pork dumplings, Japanese sticky rice with vegetables. Everything was just right. Right amount of spice, right portion size, fresh ingredients. Quite a homely feel to the place.

Also, their veg thali is something that i order almost always. The dal makhni here is like no other, with perfect spices, consistency and flavour, it is something that you would come back here for, again and again.
