It gives you a feeling that it’s been there since ages with a tribe of loyal customers. It’s like nothing has changed and that’s what people love about it. It isn’t cheap by any standards but I guess it’s a great place to grab a beer and munch on an appetiser. A big bottle of Kingfisher is for 300/- . Food: well, it’s nothing special but you can’t fault it. And that’s what brings people back here. You just can’t go wrong. They offer an array of Chinese and Japanese dishes. Some indian dishes quietly slipped in like Gobi Manchurian 😜 I tried the corn and asparagus soup, the chilly baby corn, aromatic pork dumplings, Japanese sticky rice with vegetables. Everything was just right. Right amount of spice, right portion size, fresh ingredients. Quite a homely feel to the place.

Also, their veg thali is something that i order almost always.

Having been tasted the famous Hyderabadi Biriyani from their counterpart in Secunderabad outlet in the recent past, I found this experience not so satisfying. The portion size was average and is in no match to the quantity served in Paradise outlets in Telengana. Moreover, the Nizami Mutton Biriyani also tasted quite different as far as my food memory from Secunderabad Paradise is concerned. The spice quotient was much lower, perhaps toned down to match with the taste buds of the Bengal region, but compromised with the authenticity of the dish as served in the Telengana region. Although the Nizami Mutton Biriyani tasted good, the Royal one was a complete let down for its blunt taste. Kebabs (comes in a platter of 8 pieces) were succulent and tasty, but the sizes were small compared to their pricing. However, the Qubani ka Meetha was enjoyable and the sweetness index was perfect to linger on the mouth as a sweet aftertaste. Staff were extremely courteous and attempted every bit to address the needs of the customers on a busy day.

Chettinadu Murg Kebab - (4.5/5) Priced at Rs.299, eight succulent pieces of chicken, marinated in chettinad spices were served. Recommended. Nawabi Mutton Biriyani - (5/5) Priced at Rs.381, this was the showstopper. It is supposed to serve 2 people and comes with 4 pieces of mutton, accompanied with curd, sambar & onions. The rice had a perfect balance of spices and clarified butter. The mutton pieces were soft & tender. However the quantity served is enough for 1 person and not 2. Definitely not enough for 2 people.

However the 2 chicken pieces given were very nice with the flavours intact inside, as is absent in most other biriyani joints, where one gets bland chicken pieces. However, avoid Chicken biriyani and go for Mutton. Qubani ka Meetha - (0/5) A dessert made out of stewed apricots. Similar to chutney. The texture was runny and bland. Double ka Meetha - (1.5/5) Fried bread pudding with saffron. Similar to Shahi Tukra. Despite the food being very good (however you can easily skip the kebabs & dessert, just go for the biriyani), the service was horrible. Very poor crowd management.

(209, 'Hyderabadi Paradise is in Kolkata and the biryani lovers are ecstatic. Finally packed one supreme mutton biryani this sunday. My review will only be on the food as didn''t dine there. The supreme biryani which they claim is sufficient for 4 to 5 but its actually more than sufficient for 5, no complaints about the quantity. Secondly the taste is very different from the Kolkata Biryani, I expected it to be spicy, similar to the ones served in Hyderabad Paradise but it was not. Mutton pieces were well cooked and soft but tastewise it was not exceptional. I think the biryani of Kolkata is better, do t get me wrong this biryani is good as well and can be used as a change of taste. Also on the value for money aspect I must say 1600 for 5 is a bit on the costlier side and we get better biryani at this price or even lower in Kolkata.', 3, timestamp '2020-02-09T20:33:08+0530', 205, 19319656),

And most probably this is the best pocket-friendly Chinese restaurant in town, I''m aware of right now. This is a small little restaurant just beside Jadavpur BSNL Telephone Exchange, 5 minutes walk from Jadavpur 8B Bus stand. Getting back to the food I ordered, it started with Pan-Fried Chicken - It was crunchy and savoury, served hot and well-maintained portion is provided. Garlic Chicken - The light aroma of garlic served hot and garnished with spring onions over the top, which smells too good to true. Chicken pieces are so fresh that I can''t express the freshness unless you taste it out. Devil Fish - Before ordering the dish I asked them which fish they''re gonna use for this, they answered without any hesitation that It will be Basha fish, see the loyalty towards their customer is good, and I liked this. Devilfish was surely devil in taste which get shit out of me LOL, it was super tasty, can''t be understood that this is well papered. This is highly suggested for spicy food lovers. Hong Kong Rice - It was deeply flavoured, a worth try with a selected side dish, served enough to shared with 2-3 persons. A highly suggested who prefers rice. Schezwan Fried Rice - This was a different from any other Schezwan rice, perfectly balanced with flavoured.

(218, 'Satisfy your Oriental cravings @ PETUK Jadavpur.! Spreading its wings from Hazra to Jadavpur, PETUK is all set to cater to the tastebuds with its economically ranged oriental rendezvous. Regarded as one of the best oriental hubs in this city, the food served here is in no way inferior in taste or flavor, when compared to some of the big shot names in this city. The very fact that the pricing here is low, is again in no way indicative of the fact of the quality of the food which is served here and in a way is definitely a misnomer. If you were to walk 2-3 mins straight from the Tollygunge Auto Stand at Jadavpur, making you way right past Hindustan Sweets and towards UCO Bank, PETUK would fall on your right. The outlet here is minimally sized, and would probably accommodate 15 heads at the max. We started off by customizing ourselves a MOMO platter, which had a mix of 2 Chicken Steamed Momos, 2 Chicken Fried Momos and 2 Chicken Pan Fried Momos. The Steamed Momos were some of the best in town, and so were the Pan Fried Momos. The sauce was what made the most difference, apart from the taste and flavorful filling inside. Next to come were Fish Fry, Crispy Chicken and Pan-Fried Fish in Chilli Mustard Sauce. Fish Fry and Fish Finger is definitely what PETUK is known for, and rightfully so, the Fish Fry was fingerlicking good, retaining the quality and quantity set by its HAZRA counterpart. The Fish Fry had beautiful layering of Kasundi or Mustard Sauce, along with a thick layer of the boneless fillet of fish. The crunch of the exterior, the flavor from the middle, all you would perhaps need more are some onions and a little bit more of that mustard sauce. Crispy Chicken too faired well, with the boneless strips of chicken being tossed in a sweet and tangy sauce. The Chicken was crispy and crunchy, and the sauce left a long aftermark in the tastebuds. Pan Fried Fish in Chilli Mustard Sauce was perhaps the best of the starter, with the kickness from the chillies and the tan', 5, timestamp '2020-01-31T18:06:20+0530', 214, 19319782),

(269, 'It is hard to pass by the Welcome Restaurant in the bylanes of Fort in Mumbai; this iconic restaurant was established in 1924. Surely, the offerings have morphed over the years; I hope that some of its original traits have survived the onslaught of the changing culture and demographics of the metropolis. This was one time when I was aimlessly walking by this crowded street in the Fort area and chanced upon this eatery. The place is clean and well organized. It has all the characteristics of the typical Udupi restaurant, except that its interiors had this middle era charm (as in not quite contemporary). Ambiance gets a thumbs up. Since my visit was to quickly check out the place, I ordered three bellwether items: Steamed Idli, Upma and Filter Coffee. The Steamed Idli was the hero – the idli was hot and the sambar was also piping hot; the chutney tasted fresh. The Upma was a different story: one the one side, it had those welcome tomatoes and peas but the consistency and the texture of the upma were disappointing. It was not the expected warm somewhat molten consistency, it was tepid and dry. The sambar and the chutney were unable to resurrect this fallen warrior. The coffee did not taste anything like filter coffee – it was inexorably sweet and had all the look and feel and taste of instant coffee - that was a bummer! The Idli was the last man standing. Just for that, food gets a thumbs up. Service was courteous and attentive. For the time I was there, there was a changing of the guard (as in wait person); it was seamless. The sequencing of the service was remarkable. This was one of those rare instances when Service made an attempt to make up for the food performance. Service gets an unmistakable thumbs up. Like most of the old era eateries, the South Indian restaurants are being ravaged by the unforgiving palates of the changing demographics. In their attempt to survive, these establishments are resorting to want to be all things to all palates. The result ends up ', 3, timestamp '2018-12-29T17:56:57+0530', 265, 49914),

I shall review the food part of it over here. The food starting with breakfast was pretty good. there was Idli Sambhar, Upma, Papdi Gathiya and Jalebi along with tea and coffee. all of it was decent. In lunch we were served 3 vegetables available in both jain n regular- Chole, a Paneer sabzi(paneer tikka i suppose) and one more that i didnt try. it was accompanied by kachori and dhoklas in appetizers, Basundi and Gulab Jamuns in sweets, Puri n mini Parathas in breads, Dal Fry and Rice and salads and papad. lunch was amazing too. basundi was though a bit too liquidy but no compromise on taste. For Hi-tea they served Pav Bhaji, Fried Rice and Manchurian along with tea and coffee. i didnt try Pav Bhaji. but fried rice and manchurian being jain lacked a bit on authentic indo-chinese taste because garlic isnt used in jain. but still it was decent. Pizza n Pasta were ultimate. and the fact that you could have unlimited(only 2 pieces at a time, go again in line for more :P ) only added to the joy. the pizza was a regular veggie pizza with usual toppings of a pizza gravy,tomatoes, bell peppers, onions and cheese. the pasta was jain but still amazing. it was arabietta pasta the red one. Popcorns and ice golas were free too all day. although both only in one flavour- salted and kala khata respectively. Icecream to some point disappointed as it was a small 5rs cup of vanilla. to some extent its due to soo much they gave us otherwise that we expected a better icecream!🙈 Overall from food perspective if you are at the resort you are sorted. the water park too is pretty good with many slides, wave pool and comparatively cleaner waters.

We did enjoy the breakfast, the egg bhurjee was surprisingly good in taste and enough for two. Ambience: nice place for kids. It is really large and there is ample of resting place. They could have done better with the small garden located at the entrance. The swings and slides need repair. Rooms: We booked the Super deluxe and I would say that there are a lot of things that disappointed and could have been better. 1. Not enough plugs to charge the phone and none near the bed. 2. The toilet didnt have tissue paper. 3. The TV could have been larger screen with better volume 4. They don''t provide a remote for the AC so it is either too cold or it is not. 5. The mini-fridge was only started when we entered so it took ages to cool. Common sense was lacking here. 6. The bedsheets had stains if you understand the kind of stains I am talking about . Please hire a better laundry service. Overall, the water park is great but too much crowd on weekends. If you enjoy constantly bumping into people everywhere, then do visit cause it is still value for money if you plan only a day trip. I did not appreciate that the guards did not allow me to park my bike inside the premises even though there was place and even after I told them politely that I had a room booking, they did not relent. The reception had to intervene and allow me parking. I feel your rooms are over-priced and would be value for money if you allowed access to the swimming pool and park for a few hours after 6 pm once the day trip crowds leave for the day OR atleast provide complementary food like lunch or breakfast or both. Even if you have to close the water park, give access to one of the swimming pools for the people who book your expensive rooms. Overall good water park, room service but don''t plan a stay.

Paneer satay : Paneer served on satay sticks with some tomatayish semi gravy.The dish contained 8 servings. Tandoori chicken full : See,Here the issue with tandoori chicken every where else is,It is not barbequed properly and it leaves a bad taste in the mouth.OSDD is no different.We had instructed the waiter cook it to the core and cut into small pieces.Though it was cut properly,the first instruction went out of the window. Cheese Pakoda : Cheese dipped in besan,deep fried served with green chutney.One word.decent. They also serve hard drinks like beer,whiskey,vodka etc but dont keep a drinks menu.I wonder,why?!. There were about more than ten products mentioned under "Dessert" but only Gulab Jamun was available.Reason.Unknown. Overall,A good place to hangout with friends as they are open late till 5pm.

(314, 'Hilton International Airport Hotel in Mumbai invited us to celebrate their Oktoberfest promotion (on till the 15th of October) as a precursor to the launch of their open-air grill section: The Brasserie Grill  As a part of the night, we got to sample a platter of grilled meats, cold cuts and a few pints of off the shelf beer. What we ate: 1) Beer Basted New Zealand Lamb Skewers- Roasted peppers and lamb skewers. Can''t really go wrong, can you? The lamb was soft and well-cooked while the roasted peppers added a sweet heat to the food. A nice combination that worked well. 2) Lamb Chops and Gravy: A nice, soft, pink lamb chop served on the bone with a peppery gravy to add depth of flavour and a moreish spice to the dish. The lamb was complemented by the roasted potato served that brought out the texture of the lamb and the spice of the sauce a lot more. The only drawback was that the chops served were cooked differently. One was medium while the other was a lot more on the medium-rare side. 3) German Sausages: Subtlety smoked sausages done on an open grill that paired surprisingly well with the cold brews. Nothing too fancy, just a nice sausage that gave us the tiniest of tastes of Germany! 4) Grilled chicken in Mediterranean spices: Now we love a good chicken leg and we were happy with the soft/tender texture and the strong spicy flavour as well.  5) Cold Cuts of Meat: A selection of pork and chicken cuts with marinated olives that were a nice wrap-up with our last pints of beers. The pepper pork was the highlight of the selection. Overall, the evening was pleasant thanks to the ambience (outdoor seating by the poolside). We just wish there were more vegetarian options because there was only one option which seemed lacking, and we''re surprised to find only Indian bottled/draft beers on the selection of beverages for what was a celebration of Oktoberfest.

Ok sushi rice, lots of curry sauce which was quite nice. Onion, capsicum, 2 pieces large carrot (not too firm).

As the director in charge of corporate entertainment for an extremely large and respected Aussie blue-chip company, I was considering the Sydney Tower as a venue for around 50 important overseas clients (or their representatives) when we recently brought them all to Australia for a familiarisation tour. My budget for the four day event was A$1million so I had a few options to choose from. Having never been to the tower restaurant before I assumed it was an iconic Aussie venue that would be perfect for entertaining our guests. Fortunately, reading all your reviews convinced me this would probably have been the worst place to come. I spoke to my boss about it and we both agreed it would probably cause the company irreparable harm. We ended up taking our 50 visitors to one of the high-end hotels, just to be safe. A big pity, though, that something that should be an icon for Australian tourism is so badly managed and reviewed. Please allow me to apologise to all overseas visitors that have had a bad experience at the Sydney Tower - hopefully you appreciate the bad food and poor service does not reflect Australia as a whole.

Then we were showed the offer of early bird specials on a menu so we might as well to follow their promotion to have a hot stone braised beef short rib and a hot stone seafood soup with additional order of an entrée of pan-fried dumplings. Honestly, dumplings are only passable but the other two dishes are too outstanding.  The beef ribs are slow-cooked to perfection that fall apart from the bone. Turnip pieces absorb all the flavour and they are soft. Glass noodles are extra-surprise. Besides that the seafood soup is made of many seafood with shelled prawns, mussels, half sand crab and squid.

Located in simultaneously an awkward yet proximal place, Asian Food Paradise is snuggled in an array of stores on a side street just off multiple main roads (and across the lane from a gas station, to boot). As standard looking as it may be (it is nothing that is unique), if approached with an open mind it is quite a wholesome choice. It is more a take-out than anything; there is the presence of tables for people waiting for their order. The waitress there did what she need to do, and was helpful in my order (I paid by EFTPOS, but was under the minimum - a half order of an entree was allowed). When the order was placed, she suggested to sit down - quite courteous. There was not a lot to the interior, it was a small area for takeaway. It did embelish family-orientation. For my order, there was a $7 lunch special menu (with $1 extra for fried rice and $1 for a can of soda with the exception of Coke) of 15 or so dishes. I chose a salt and pepper chicken with fried rice and a half order of spring rolls. The dish was surprisingly spicy, an agreeable temperature and translated pretty well. There could be improvement on the fried rice - it was a bit plain for fried rice and could have had more substance (such as egg, corn etc) and would have suffered if it was eaten by itself. The spring rolls were better than average and I could detect actual ingredients in the filling. Overall, a decent meal for the folk short on time. I have been to Asian Food Paradise several times before, and they have had good food - slightly different from the Chinese and Thai that are common in the situated area.

There was six of us and only one other occupied table in the restaurant, yet somehow it took over an hour for all our mains to be brought out. By the time my egg noodles came, everyone else had finished their food. The wait staff did not check up on us, so if we wanted to order a drink we had to walk up to the cash register and wait to be attended. The drink never came, so we had to ask again twenty minutes later. We ordered four fried ice creams to follow our meals, but they never came. Everyone else had left the restaurant and we were still there waiting for food as the staff were mopping the floors out the front. By then we''d been there for two hours. We tried to find someone to ask about the progress of the order, but were told it was "coming". It had been about 40 minutes since we finished our meals when we asked for a second time about the order, and the waitress informed us that they had forgotten about it. Argh! When we went to pay, there was an added charge on our bill. It turned out that instead of bringing us the entree for four that we had ordered (two people in our group of 6 were vego), they had brought us an entree for six and thus doubled the price. The woman behind the counter refused to change the amount. We were already aggravated after waiting so long for food and drinks that never came.

The dry curry mee was very good but we weren''t that impressed with the laksa - it had a more buttery rather than coconut milk flavour and they used short fat rice noodles ("mouse tail" noodles) which are not our favourite.

Ketupat (compressed rice) is available for $2. These Chicken Skewers are grilled under an electric stove as charcoal grilling is banned. The Chicken is nicely marinated, tasty and tender. Dipped in the Satay Sauce, this is a delicious entree. Highly recommended! Many restaurants deep fry their Satay Skewers to save time. This is blasphemy and an unheard of practice in Malaysia. Rating: 4.5 *Nasi Lemak with Beef Rendang ($13) comes with steamed rice, half boiled egg, Sambal, Peanuts and Fried Anchovies. I was disappointed coconut rice was not served. The Beef Rendang and Sambal is delicious but the overall serving is small compared to Papparich, Taste of Penang, Sri Makhota, Malaya Corner and Singapore & Co. Rating: 4 * Kuih Lapis (3 for $5) is left uncovered in the refrigerated cabinet. Hence, the top layer is hard and inedible while the rest of the Kuih tastes quite average. Not recommended.

They might have changed the location because I found the venue is different from last time but more spacious and modernised.  Incidentally, I was back from Penang prior to the exploration so found that the way that they prepared the Malaysian dishes was different from what I had in Malaysia. Having said that it does not mean that they are not authentic. Portions were still not generous as before but very tasteful; particularly the satay sauce. We has the dinner at mid-March with voucher deal, otherwise we might paid over-prices there.   Rating 3.5/5      Aug 09, 2014  Rating 3/5  Authentic or valuable?. Have tried the Satay Ayam, Ayam Goreng, Seafood Laksa and Seafood Mee Goreng. Feeling is so so.   One thing that wouldn''t score the ''like'' is the small portion that they served. Being a Malaysian restaurant, it is definitely fair to provide authentic Malaysian food, however, customers always would like to have larger portion for value and appetite particular when the food is yummy.   Char-grilled Chicken satay just done perfect with nice sweet satay sauce, however, the Ayam Goreng (Fried chicken wing) was dry and tasteless. Mee Goreng only comes with two small pieces of prawn and some half-cut fish balls and the noodle was too hard (seems under-cooked). The seafood Laksa was done with different types of noodles than other Malyasian restaurants, which may due to the fact that the chef is originated from different part of Malaysia but the Laksa did not give me the usual taste, not to mention the one that I had in Malaysia at KL & Ipoh.

I watched on as one by one the dishes for the other tables came out. Eventually everyone in the restaurant was eating, apart from me. At this point, my fiance had already finished 3 quarters of his meal. I asked the waitress about my soup and she said that the kitchen had forgotten about my order as there were only 2 cooks in the kitchen (not sure how this poses a challenge). I do not understand what was so difficult about putting together a bowl of soup (the stock/broth should already been boiling away in a pot), just had to throw in the noodles and meatballs! When the soup finally came, I had lost my appetite as I was very unhappy. The vermicelli noodles looked sad, there were only 6 tiny meatballs. The soup was overpowering with white pepper. It was obviously put together in a rush without any attention to detail. If we hadn''t paid beforehand I seriously considered walking out. I voiced my dissatisfaction, the waitress apologised and offered 2 slices of kuih seri muka as compensation. At least there was some customer service provided. If the restaurant was jam packed and service was busy, I can understand that it would be easy to forget an order; but this was on a rainy Sunday, with only 3 tables to serve.

(894, 'Sacher Torte that blew my mind!. My love and I attend this quirky place as regularly as possible - it''s a special romantic spot for us, where we share a pot of tea, or a coffee and an Asian bakery item in peace. Often there are one or two interesting Valley characters hanging out but mostly it is very quiet. Where can you get a pot of tea for two for $2-70? On a whim one day I bought a Sacher Torte from the display and almost immediately regretted it. Why would an Asian bakery know how to make a Sacher Torte? How wrong could we be - best Sacher Torte ever - moist liqueur centre, fresh chocolate cake and icing. Sensational!', 0, timestamp '2013-02-20T10:01:25+1030', 839, 16592599),
(895, 'Pretty disappointing experience. I had heard so much about this place and was really expecting to like it. We had a booking for 7:45, and the table that we were eventually sat at was empty from the time we arrived. We however had to wait until 8:20 before we were seated. While we waited at the bar, we ordered French martini’s. The cocktails were extremely watered down with pineapple juice and were very disappointing for the price. The bar staff were generally not very friendly either. At dinner, we were never given 2 of the dishes we ordered, but did not realise until we had already gone home. Service was pretty non existent all night. The food we did receive was good, but not good enough to make up for everything else. I was just pretty disappointed with the whole experience. Considering that this place is not cheap and there are several other amazing, high end restaurants across the road, I expected better.', 2, timestamp '2019-06-07T09:40:38+0930', 840, 16592603),
(896, 'Bucci has long been a family favourite & today just reaffirmed why. Few Italian restaurants can provide authentic food and flavours, with a modern, refreshing twist. Bucci is one that can and does - consistently. Always welcoming- service is friendly but not familiar. Efficient, professional and the pace is always just right. Our meals were perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. Portion sizes generous and perfect for sharing. Chef attended the table to recommend a few dishes which were outstanding. Excellent location. Love it!', 5, timestamp '2019-01-06T08:09:16+1030', 841, 16592603),

(898, 'I was part of  Hen''s night that recently booked out the private dining room at Bucci. We had a set menu and I was so excited to see that there were actually several options for me on it. The pasta I had was just a simple tomato and garlic sauce but it was absolutely delicious! the serving size did seem quite small for the price, however it was surprisingly filling and I am still dreaming about it. The service was very good (they were super tolerant of a bunch of loud girls) and the waiter made a note of my dietary issues and clearly passed this on to the other staff. Looking at the regular menu on their website it is a shame that they don''t list what can be GF etc on the menu (other than that they offer GF pasta) so it''s hard for me to get excited about visiting again and what I might order. Won''t stop me coming back though!', 4.5, timestamp '2018-04-10T14:11:20+0930', 843, 16592603),
(899, 'My partner and I went to Bucci with high expectations and sadly these expectations were not met. My partner had the Bucci angnolotti which I must say was lovely. However, I had the carbonara and it was extremely salty and very disappointing. The cost of the dishes did not reflect the taste of the food we had. The service was very mediocre as we found it difficult to spot a server and grab their attention. ', 3, timestamp '2018-03-30T09:57:57+1030', 844, 16592603),
(900, 'I could not wait to get home to review this restaurant. What a shocker. Group of 12. 2 of the people enjoyed their meal. One of the party thought their Moreton bay bug dish tasted like 2 minute noodles had as a child. My pork belly was $38. It was fatty. The crackling was soft therefore inedible (for me, others may like theirs soft). I like the crackling to be just that. crackling. 3 bites and all the meat was gone. Yes, I did ask if the chef could “crispy” up the crackling. saw this done on Masterchef by turning the skin face down onto a hot pan. took minutes. no, sorry we cannot make the skin crackling “crackly” for you. Bill was $720 for 12 . I don’t mind paying for quality so the money is not the issue, it is just that I did not receive quality.

(902, 'My wife and I came in on Saturday night for her work''s Christmas Party. We were a little late getting in, so by the time we were seated several antipasto platters were already on the table, and the staff were quick to take ours drinks orders. There were some language barriers with one of our waiters, but he was patient with us and our drinks were brought out promptly. The antipasto platters were excellent, with just enough of everything that everybody could have a couple of bites with our drinks while we waited for mains. I had the Bucci Angolotti while my wife had the Tagliatelle Con Cicale Di Mare. While both were wonderful, my wife''s gluten free replacement option for tagliatelle was box penne which was a little disappointing. For dessert we both had the Chocolate Nemesis Del "The River Cafe". What came out was a piece of cake that is taste and texture was very much like a well made brownie. I loved it immensely for it''s flavor and texture and how well it went with the mascarpone. One comment made by several people at our table was that there was a tendancy for the waitstaff to hover. Attentive service is always appreciated, but it seemed like a fork or a glass couldn''t be put down without somebody appearing behind us. The few cocktails we had were excellent as well. I would recommend the Amaretto Sour to anybody that way inclined, and the spirits list, while not extensive, has plenty of mid and high range options to keep spirit heads happy. The only major issue was paying. There were some drinks missing off the bill and items appearing not to be paid for when they had. It was sorted out in the end but it made the end of the night a bit of a mess. Overall though the food is lovely, the vibe is good, and the drinks are great.
