Tried the 'Chicken Tom Kha' and 'Veg Wonton Soup' which were both amazing. Had the 'Honey Chilli Potatoes' sans the honey, which was perfect, crisp and spicy. The only disappointment was the 'Chicken Pan Fried Noodles'. The dish was way too oily and the pan frying wasn't done well, hence the crust wasn't formed perfectly and the noodles weren't as crispy at the bottom. The service was a tad bit too slow and very disorganized. They brought in the appetizer before the soup which was very weird. The pricing was perfect though.

This casual dining place serves Chinese, Japanese and Thai cuisine. Place is beautifully done and has warm vibes. Staff is warm and courteous. For appetizers, \u00a0I had\u00a0 honey chilli potato which were crispy with sweet and spicy notes -it will definitely activate your tastebuds. Spring rolls were little oily but tasted good and it paired well with chilly garlic dip. Crispy tangy button mushrooms are definitely worth trying especially for funghi lovers. For main course, I had \u00a0Veg manchurian \u00a0which was tasty and manchurian balls were soft. Mushroom dimsums were the star dish here.\u00a0 I would love to recommend it.Thumbs up! Momo lovers should definitely try. I ended my meal with darsan and date pancakes- both these desserts were out of the box and tasted heavenly.

place is my first love, being a vegetarian it\u2019s hard to find pure veg restaurants that serve food this tasty. It has been at this location since decades and have been maintaining the quality and taste of food without fail. It\u2019s a perfect place for family dinners and is fairly priced as well. I personally love their kababs, paneer tikka, sahi ke kabab and tabdoori pineapple. All of these have a distinct flavour which stands out from other restaurants. Also, their veg thali is something that i order almost always. The dal makhni here is like no other, with perfect spices, consistency and flavour, it is something that you would come back here for, again and again.

I recently went there with a friend of mine and loved the place to bits. I started with a Tandoori platter and a kebab platter and both the platters are to die for. Grilled pineapple, mushrooms, dahi ke kebabs were the best out of both the platters. Further, they have a huge menu with lots of variety of main course dishes. I had Dal Makhani, Veg Biryani , Soya Rara and Palak Kofta and all of them were delicious. If you are coming here don't forget to try their chaap/soya preparations because they are to die for. Palak Kofta is a must try from my side. You can end the meal with ksheeram which is made with carrot, bottle gaurd and almonds. To be honest, bottle gaurd might not sound too appetizing but this dessert was absolutely delicious. (Highly recommended!)

They also have a fully stocked bar and I would really recommend their drinks as they were really good. The staff is also very polite and our server Shanky was really helpful.

I have to say the place has a warm and family kind of touch to it. As soon as you step inside, you get the vibe of a vintage place.

The place is super cramped since their dining on the top has been sealed. You can overhear the conversations from the next table \ud83e\udd37 We order naan, butter chicken and chef suggested special non veg pulav. The butter chicken was itself disappointing. Tasted more like a tomato soup with chicken in it. The chicken wasn't juicy and/ or tender. Tasted very bland. The special pulav was a mix of chicken, mutton and egg.

As we went to the place it looked good, and something to look forward too, as expected i ordered the duck and to my surprise the waiter said that it was not available, i told them that i asked in advance and then only came to the place, so the manager intervened and said that the duck had turned bad as it was a little old and it may not taste good, so that's why we aren't serving it, a little odd it was and no doubt my expectations came crashing down, but still i was hungry so decided to give other dishes a try. I had: Crispy chilli lamb: Shredded lamb cooked with onions and capsicum, this one was a disappointment the lamb was very dry and lavked any kind of flavour, it was just spocy, nothing else, nothing more, not a good one. Basil chilli crab: A chilli crab dish that looked good on the menu, but very bad on the plate, it was just a disaster of the dish, that it looked so bad on the plate too, the crab too was overcooked that meat felt like a chewing gum, no flavour. The dishes were disappointing, taste so bad, presentation totally dead and the duck incident just strange, no words.","locale":"en-IN"},"score":1,"user":{"first_name,":"Sahil","profile_name":"Sahil Arora","last_initial":"Arora","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/cb4/e1a57d35b244f4657f907792f0570cb4.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/cb4/e1a57d35b244f4657f907792f0570cb4.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/cb4/e1a57d35b244f4657f907792f0570cb4.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/cb4/e1a57d35b244f4657f907792f0570cb4.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"44175736","date_added":"2019-07-25T21:45:47+0530","review":{"text":"Since 5 years I have been going to this place to have Chinese food, very good service, atmosphere is also good, the food quality and quantity is sufficient, overall excellent.

To me the taste resembled Behrouz Biryani minus the almonds and somewhat similar to the Hyderabadi biriyani served at Khwab, slightly better. Tamarind also makes a very good Hyderabadi Biryani.

Settings arrangements quite comfortable. We're ordered kabab and nizami mutton biryani. both dishes are lip smacking good. flavour of the biryani is different computations others well known biryani joints in Kolkata.

As it was Valentine's day, the crowd was huge and the wait was longer than usual days. This was my first visit based on the reputation of the name of this eatery. Tried the Nizami Mutton Biriyani (comes with the Salam and raita), Royal Mutton Biriyani (without the accompaniments), Chettinud chicken kebabs and Qubani ka Meetha for dessert. Having been tasted the famous Hyderabadi Biriyani from their counterpart in Secunderabad outlet in the recent past, I found this experience not so satisfying. The portion size was average and is in no match to the quantity served in Paradise outlets in Telengana. Moreover, the Nizami Mutton Biriyani also tasted quite different as far as my food memory from Secunderabad Paradise is concerned. The spice quotient was much lower, perhaps toned down to match with the taste buds of the Bengal region, but compromised with the authenticity of the dish as served in the Telengana region. Although the Nizami Mutton Biriyani tasted good, the Royal one was a complete let down for its blunt taste. Kebabs (comes in a platter of 8 pieces) were succulent and tasty, but the sizes were small compared to their pricing. However, the Qubani ka Meetha was enjoyable and the sweetness index was perfect to linger on the mouth as a sweet aftertaste. Staff were extremely courteous and attempted every bit to address the needs of the customers on a busy day. As a food lover, my humble suggestion to the authority would be to seriously look into the portion sizes as it stands in no match with their original counterparts in Telengana. P.S:- The ambience of the place was in sync with their original counterpart where you can enjoy the food in complete harmony with others instead of a private kind of dining experience.","locale":"en-IN"},"score":3,"user":{"first_name,":"Sohini","profile_name":"Sohini Basu","last_initial":"Basu","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/2bd/230cdd69c38126a3025dff98c16de2bd.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/2bd/230cdd69c38126a3025dff98c16de2bd.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/2bd/230cdd69c38126a3025dff98c16de2bd.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/2bd/230cdd69c38126a3025dff98c16de2bd.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"48082826","date_added":"2020-02-15T14:37:51+0530","review":{"text":"The renowned Paradise Biryani has finally made it to Kolkata.

Experienced mixed feelings about this food joint. The food met my expectations but the service was abysmally poor. Coming to the food : Sweet Lime Soda - (2/5) Priced at Rs.48, it was overtly sweet and not refreshing at all. Chettinadu Murg Kebab - (4.5/5) Priced at Rs.299, eight succulent pieces of chicken, marinated in chettinad spices were served. Recommended. Nawabi Mutton Biriyani - (5/5) Priced at Rs.381, this was the showstopper. It is supposed to serve 2 people and comes with 4 pieces of mutton, accompanied with curd, sambar & onions. The rice had a perfect balance of spices and clarified butter. The mutton pieces were soft & tender. However the quantity served is enough for 1 person and not 2. Definitely not enough for 2 people. Unlike the original Paradise Hyderabadi Biriyani, the spice quotient is toned down to match the Kolkata palate and the result is really good. Highly recommended. Nawabi Chicken Biriyani - (3.5) Priced at Rs.381, this was a letdown after the mutton biriyani. The rice was more bland than the mutton biriyani. However the 2 chicken pieces given were very nice with the flavours intact inside, as is absent in most other biriyani joints, where one gets bland chicken pieces. However, avoid Chicken biriyani and go for Mutton. Qubani ka Meetha - (0/5) A dessert made out of stewed apricots. Similar to chutney. The texture was runny and bland. Double ka Meetha - (1.5/5) Fried bread pudding with saffron. Similar to Shahi Tukra. Despite the food being very good (however you can easily skip the kebabs & dessert, just go for the biriyani), the service was horrible. Very poor crowd management. The waiting line was not managed properly. The washroom was very dirty. Nawabi Biriyani which is supposed to serve 2 people was sufficient for only 1 person. Mutton biriyani got over at 9pm and had to order chicken biriyani after that. They closed the restaurant at 9:30 pm whereas it is supposed to be open till 11pm. The food scene in Kolkata is a tough one and Paradise has to really buck up in terms of service in order to compete with the other biriyani joints. A lot of other customers had the same complaints as us. Was not at all impressed with service.

The supreme biryani which they claim is sufficient for 4 to 5 but its actually more than sufficient for 5, no complaints about the quantity. Secondly the taste is very different from the Kolkata Biryani, I expected it to be spicy, similar to the ones served in Hyderabad Paradise but it was not. Mutton pieces were well cooked and soft but tastewise it was not exceptional. I think the biryani of Kolkata is better, do t get me wrong this biryani is good as well and can be used as a change of taste. Also on the value for money aspect I must say 1600 for 5 is a bit on the costlier side and we get better biryani at this price or even lower in Kolkata.","locale":"en-IN"},"score":3,"user":{"first_name,":"Abhishek","profile_name":"Abhishek Sarvadhikari","last_initial":"Sarvadhikari","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/32a/08a79e5b7f247d90d6a079cd1538032a.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/32a/08a79e5b7f247d90d6a079cd1538032a.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/32a/08a79e5b7f247d90d6a079cd1538032a.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/32a/08a79e5b7f247d90d6a079cd1538032a.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"47897087","date_added":"2020-02-07T22:11:52+0530","review":{"text":"Last Sunday we went to Paradise biryani in southern avenue.

is Petuk's second Outlet after Hazra, best known for their quality for serving some authentic Chinese food which will never settle before it awws you! And most probably this is the best pocket-friendly Chinese restaurant in town, I'm aware of right now. This is a small little restaurant just beside Jadavpur BSNL Telephone Exchange, 5 minutes walk from Jadavpur 8B Bus stand. Getting back to the food I ordered, it started with Pan-Fried Chicken - It was crunchy and savoury, served hot and well-maintained portion is provided. Garlic Chicken - The light aroma of garlic served hot and garnished with spring onions over the top, which smells too good to true. Chicken pieces are so fresh that I can't express the freshness unless you taste it out. Devil Fish - Before ordering the dish I asked them which fish they're gonna use for this, they answered without any hesitation that It will be Basha fish, see the loyalty towards their customer is good, and I liked this. Devilfish was surely devil in taste which get shit out of me LOL, it was super tasty, can't be understood that this is well papered. This is highly suggested for spicy food lovers. Hong Kong Rice - It was deeply flavoured, a worth try with a selected side dish, served enough to shared with 2-3 persons. A highly suggested who prefers rice. Schezwan Fried Rice - This was a different from any other Schezwan rice, perfectly balanced with flavoured. The Manager was very humble, their service was good and we will visit again because we're die-hard petuk to try out their other items which were left unexplored.","locale":"en-IN"},"score":5,"user":{"first_name,":"Tushar","profile_name":"Tushar Kanti Murmu","last_initial":"Kanti","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/8f0/3f63cae7dbebfe1a6ede11cc28c6a8f0.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/8f0/3f63cae7dbebfe1a6ede11cc28c6a8f0.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/8f0/3f63cae7dbebfe1a6ede11cc28c6a8f0.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/8f0/3f63cae7dbebfe1a6ede11cc28c6a8f0.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"48117193","date_added":"2020-02-16T19:39:50+0530","review":{"text":"I just love their food. This small place is serving some great quality food. Staffs are friendly. Service is fast and efficient. Nothing to say much about the ambiance much. It was pretty ordinary. Recommended dishes are. 1. Momo Platter\u2013 Consists of Steamed, Fried and Pan Fried Momo and a delicious soup. They are serving some awesome momos. 2. Fish Fry\u2013 Very yummy. 3. Crispy Chicken\u2013 Awesome in taste. 4. Burnt Garlic Rice\u2013 Outstanding in taste. Quantity is sufficient for 2 person. 5. Chicken Manchurian\u2013 Gone very well with the rice. Because it has perfect balance of flavours. 6. Pan Fried Fish in Chilli Mustard Sauce\u2013 Another superb dish from their kitchen. Yummy and drooling. So, next time you are near 8B Bus Stand, Jadavpur give this place a try. Pocket pinch is very reasonable. Disclaimer: This review is based on invitation from The Restaurant Management.

Spreading its wings from Hazra to Jadavpur, PETUK is all set to cater to the tastebuds with its economically ranged oriental rendezvous. Regarded as one of the best oriental hubs in this city, the food served here is in no way inferior in taste or flavor, when compared to some of the big shot names in this city. The very fact that the pricing here is low, is again in no way indicative of the fact of the quality of the food which is served here and in a way is definitely a misnomer. If you were to walk 2-3 mins straight from the Tollygunge Auto Stand at Jadavpur, making you way right past Hindustan Sweets and towards UCO Bank, PETUK would fall on your right. The outlet here is minimally sized, and would probably accommodate 15 heads at the max. We started off by customizing ourselves a MOMO platter, which had a mix of 2 Chicken Steamed Momos, 2 Chicken Fried Momos and 2 Chicken Pan Fried Momos. The Steamed Momos were some of the best in town, and so were the Pan Fried Momos. The sauce was what made the most difference, apart from the taste and flavorful filling inside. Next to come were Fish Fry, Crispy Chicken and Pan-Fried Fish in Chilli Mustard Sauce. Fish Fry and Fish Finger is definitely what PETUK is known for, and rightfully so, the Fish Fry was fingerlicking good, retaining the quality and quantity set by its HAZRA counterpart. The Fish Fry had beautiful layering of Kasundi or Mustard Sauce, along with a thick layer of the boneless fillet of fish. The crunch of the exterior, the flavor from the middle, all you would perhaps need more are some onions and a little bit more of that mustard sauce. Crispy Chicken too faired well, with the boneless strips of chicken being tossed in a sweet and tangy sauce. The Chicken was crispy and crunchy, and the sauce left a long aftermark in the tastebuds. Pan Fried Fish in Chilli Mustard Sauce was perhaps the best of the starter, with the kickness from the chillies and the tanginess from the mustard getting infused within the delicate flavor of the fish. For the maincourse, we tried Burnt Garlic Fried Rice, whose aroma and flavor made us spellbound. A perfect accompaniment to this was the Chicken Manchurian, something we loved relishing here. Both the quantity and quality was more than expected and hence was a good value for money. #oriental #chinese #starter #maincourse #fishfry #fishfinger #PETUK #Hazra #Jadavpur #PETUKHazra #PETUKJadavpur #whenstomachtickles","locale":"en-IN"},"score":5,"user":{"first_name,":"Dipyaman","profile_name":"Dipyaman Basu (whenstomachtickles)","last_initial":"Basu","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/8d3/ed0c925c8d1e07fefa33f7d8e98328d3.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/8d3/ed0c925c8d1e07fefa33f7d8e98328d3.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/8d3/ed0c925c8d1e07fefa33f7d8e98328d3.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/8d3/ed0c925c8d1e07fefa33f7d8e98328d3.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"47662688","date_added":"2020-01-29T17:24:39+0530","review":{"text":"Petuk Jadavpur is there second outlet after Hazra Road. this one is a complete chinese set up as of now.

We ordered 'Afghani tandoori lamb burger', 'peri peri chicken burger', 'bbq wings'chicken jumbo wrap', 'berry shake','lime and mint mojito' and 'Cuban classic mojito'. The burgers were made to perfection, with juiciest patty and freshest lettuce. The buns were very fresh and soft, too. We also liked the taste of the wrap. The wings were perfectly tossed with the bbq sauce and the meat was perfectly cooked. All the thirst quenchers were thoroughly cooked.

Surely, the offerings have morphed over the years; I hope that some of its original traits have survived the onslaught of the changing culture and demographics of the metropolis. This was one time when I was aimlessly walking by this crowded street in the Fort area and chanced upon this eatery. The place is clean and well organized. It has all the characteristics of the typical Udupi restaurant, except that its interiors had this middle era charm (as in not quite contemporary). Ambiance gets a thumbs up. Since my visit was to quickly check out the place, I ordered three bellwether items: Steamed Idli, Upma and Filter Coffee. The Steamed Idli was the hero \u2013 the idli was hot and the sambar was also piping hot; the chutney tasted fresh. The Upma was a different story: one the one side, it had those welcome tomatoes and peas but the consistency and the texture of the upma were disappointing. It was not the expected warm somewhat molten consistency, it was tepid and dry. The sambar and the chutney were unable to resurrect this fallen warrior. The coffee did not taste anything like filter coffee \u2013 it was inexorably sweet and had all the look and feel and taste of instant coffee - that was a bummer! The Idli was the last man standing. Just for that, food gets a thumbs up. Service was courteous and attentive. For the time I was there, there was a changing of the guard (as in wait person); it was seamless. The sequencing of the service was remarkable. This was one of those rare instances when Service made an attempt to make up for the food performance. Service gets an unmistakable thumbs up. Like most of the old era eateries, the South Indian restaurants are being ravaged by the unforgiving palates of the changing demographics. In their attempt to survive, these establishments are resorting to want to be all things to all palates. The result ends up in the broadest imaginable spectrum of cuisines - a midstream world of confused identity. If only these restaurants would stick to their core competencies, I am sure, at a minimum, they would have an identity \u2013 which, hopefully, will reflect in the economics. Overall, my experience was okay, not exhilarating. The hero was the Idli. Yes, I would go back for the Idli, should I find myself in the area.","locale":"en-IN"},"score":3,"user":{"first_name,":"Duleep","profile_name":"Duleep Thomas","last_initial":"Thomas","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/user_avatars/mug_2x.png?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/user_avatars/mug_2x.png?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/user_avatars/mug_2x.png?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/user_avatars/mug_2x.png?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"39867884","date_added":"2018-10-30T22:06:15+0530","review":{"text":"Welcome restaurant is the famous restaurant in fort this is veg restaurant in fort there many dishe indean , south indean , chinese , iltay,in restaurant.","locale":"en-IN"},"score":5,"user":{"first_name,":"Sushant","profile_name":"Sushant Kalantre","last_initial":"Kalantre","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/dba/528eaeb976647ca73bb6f184ec5fcdba.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/dba/528eaeb976647ca73bb6f184ec5fcdba.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/dba/528eaeb976647ca73bb6f184ec5fcdba.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/dba/528eaeb976647ca73bb6f184ec5fcdba.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"39663713","date_added":"2018-10-18T14:02:11+0530","review":{"text":"Welcome restaurant is a very old restaurant in Fort in welcome restaurant there are many dishes Got like Indian South Indian Gujarati and Punjabi dishes .The fitter coffee made my day.

I was expecting just something average, but I have to say this was definitely one of the best chicken tikkas I have had in sometime.

As the menu of both of the places is similar we decided to try Hotel Ekveera for a change as we had visited sai krupa a number of times. The lower level was decently occupied on a weekend so we decided to try the upper level overlooking the highway. Recommended only for men. We ordered a mutton lapeta and chicken koliwada alongwith some rice bhakris. The service was very slow compared to sai krupa and we had to remind the waiter a number of times about the order. After a much delayed wait the food arrived. The mutton lapeta looked good, quantity a bit less even for a half portion but was super salty. Seems it is deliberately made salty keeping the drinkers in mind. The chicken koliwada was edible though it was quite bony. The soft drinks we ordered also took quite a time to be served. Overall the experience was quite average and we learnt a lesson to stick to the tried and tested places.

I shall review the food part of it over here. The food starting with breakfast was pretty good. there was Idli Sambhar, Upma, Papdi Gathiya and Jalebi along with tea and coffee. all of it was decent. In lunch we were served 3 vegetables available in both jain n regular- Chole, a Paneer sabzi(paneer tikka i suppose) and one more that i didnt try. it was accompanied by kachori and dhoklas in appetizers, Basundi and Gulab Jamuns in sweets, Puri n mini Parathas in breads, Dal Fry and Rice and salads and papad. lunch was amazing too. basundi was though a bit too liquidy but no compromise on taste. For Hi-tea they served Pav Bhaji, Fried Rice and Manchurian along with tea and coffee. i didnt try Pav Bhaji. but fried rice and manchurian being jain lacked a bit on authentic indo-chinese taste because garlic isnt used in jain. but still it was decent. Pizza n Pasta were ultimate. and the fact that you could have unlimited(only 2 pieces at a time, go again in line for more :P ) only added to the joy. the pizza was a regular veggie pizza with usual toppings of a pizza gravy,tomatoes, bell peppers, onions and cheese. the pasta was jain but still amazing. it was arabietta pasta the red one. Popcorns and ice golas were free too all day. although both only in one flavour- salted and kala khata respectively. Icecream to some point disappointed as it was a small 5rs cup of vanilla. to some extent its due to soo much they gave us otherwise that we expected a better icecream!\ud83d\ude48 Overall from food perspective if you are at the resort you are sorted. the water park too is pretty good with many slides, wave pool and comparatively cleaner waters. PS- Sorry for lack of food pics as I kept my phone in the locker since we were heading for the pool!

We ordered the chicken malvani. It was nowhere close to spicy and was disappointingly salty. The rest of the items we ordered were just about average. We did enjoy the breakfast, the egg bhurjee was surprisingly good in taste and enough for two. Ambience: nice place for kids. It is really large and there is ample of resting place. They could have done better with the small garden located at the entrance. The swings and slides need repair. Rooms: We booked the Super deluxe and I would say that there are a lot of things that disappointed and could have been better. 1. Not enough plugs to charge the phone and none near the bed. 2. The toilet didnt have tissue paper. 3. The TV could have been larger screen with better volume 4. They don't provide a remote for the AC so it is either too cold or it is not. 5. The mini-fridge was only started when we entered so it took ages to cool. Common sense was lacking here. 6. The bedsheets had stains if you understand the kind of stains I am talking about . Please hire a better laundry service. Overall, the water park is great but too much crowd on weekends. If you enjoy constantly bumping into people everywhere, then do visit cause it is still value for money if you plan only a day trip. I did not appreciate that the guards did not allow me to park my bike inside the premises even though there was place and even after I told them politely that I had a room booking, they did not relent. The reception had to intervene and allow me parking. I feel your rooms are over-priced and would be value for money if you allowed access to the swimming pool and park for a few hours after 6 pm once the day trip crowds leave for the day OR atleast provide complementary food like lunch or breakfast or both. Even if you have to close the water park, give access to one of the swimming pools for the people who book your expensive rooms. Overall good water park, room service but don't plan a stay.

During winters, opt for the outdoor arrangement. There was suppose to be karaoke night but as there were hardly any customers I think it dint roll out which was a disappointment. While the bowling game was on and the competition was getting serious between our teams. We ordered for starters (veg) : Idli Chilly, Paneer Sattay and Crispy Roll. Idli Chilly and crispy roll were good. The stand out was Paneer Sattay. The paneer was coated with peanut sauce, not too sweet but had nice creamy texture, it is not for the ones looking for spicy starters.

One of the best theme based place I have ever visited in located at Bhiwandi Kalyan highway. Just awesome place to visit with friends and family.

There wasn't any booze in our menu. We had ordered : Veg Spring rolls and Chickens starters The starters were good enough. In the main course, we ordered Baigan Bharta and one chicken gravy,rotis and Dal khichdi. Out of it Baigan Bharta was not at all good. We asked to change it but of no use.

Paneer satay : Paneer served on satay sticks with some tomatayish semi gravy.The dish contained 8 servings. Tandoori chicken full : See,Here the issue with tandoori chicken every where else is,It is not barbequed properly and it leaves a bad taste in the mouth.OSDD is no different.We had instructed the waiter cook it to the core and cut into small pieces.Though it was cut properly,the first instruction went out of the window. Cheese Pakoda : Cheese dipped in besan,deep fried served with green chutney.One word.decent. They also serve hard drinks like beer,whiskey,vodka etc but dont keep a drinks menu.I wonder,why?!.

International Airport Hotel in Mumbai invited us to celebrate their Oktoberfest promotion (on till the 15th of October) as a precursor to the launch of their open-air grill section: The Brasserie Grill\u00a0 As a part of the night, we got to sample a platter of grilled meats, cold cuts and a few pints of off the shelf beer. What we ate: 1) Beer Basted New Zealand Lamb Skewers- Roasted peppers and lamb skewers. Can't really go wrong, can you? The lamb was soft and well-cooked while the roasted peppers added a sweet heat to the food. A nice combination that worked well. 2) Lamb Chops and Gravy: A nice, soft, pink lamb chop served on the bone with a peppery gravy to add depth of flavour and a moreish spice to the dish. The lamb was complemented by the roasted potato served that brought out the texture of the lamb and the spice of the sauce a lot more. The only drawback was that the chops served were cooked differently. One was medium while the other was a lot more on the medium-rare side. 3) German Sausages: Subtlety smoked sausages done on an open grill that paired surprisingly well with the cold brews. Nothing too fancy, just a nice sausage that gave us the tiniest of tastes of Germany! 4) Grilled chicken in Mediterranean spices: Now we love a good chicken leg and we were happy with the soft/tender texture and the strong spicy flavour as well.\u00a0 5) Cold Cuts of Meat: A selection of pork and chicken cuts with marinated olives that were a nice wrap-up with our last pints of beers. The pepper pork was the highlight of the selection. Overall, the evening was pleasant thanks to the ambience (outdoor seating by the poolside). We just wish there were more vegetarian options because there was only one option which seemed lacking, and we're surprised to find only Indian bottled/draft beers on the selection of beverages for what was a celebration of Oktoberfest. On the other hand, if you are hardcore non-vegetarian and fond of beer (they did also have a table for beer pong) you will have a good time.","locale":"en-IN"},"score":4,"user":{"first_name,":"The","profile_name":"The Hungry Chashmish","last_initial":"Hungry","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/c2c/a74e129840950315e62c925aa2558c2c.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/c2c/a74e129840950315e62c925aa2558c2c.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/c2c/a74e129840950315e62c925aa2558c2c.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/c2c/a74e129840950315e62c925aa2558c2c.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"45486520","date_added":"2019-10-06T19:12:41+0530","review":{"text":"The Brasserie Grill is back with a bang with their Oktoberfest from 3rd October to 15th October 2019.

We ordered two pizzas and one fries. Its pretty cool to watch the machine prepare the pizza but they are not user friendly and require restaurant staff to program in each item on a very outdated UI. The machine ran out of toppings after the first pizza (which was a blessing in disguise). Coming to the taste, the fires were under cooked and tasted like boiled potatoes. The pizza was the worst that I have ever had and I have had some very bad tasting pizzas. The base was raw and pasticy. Toppings did not taste fresh. Cheese and sauce were not impressive either. There were three staff members in the restaurant and I feel that having them prepare the food would be a much better option instead of this ineffective gimmick.","locale":"en-IN"},"score":1,"user":{"first_name,":"Mohit","profile_name":"Mohit Goyal","last_initial":"Goyal","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/fd3/86ff9d2231d1187dadd736557268afd3.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/fd3/86ff9d2231d1187dadd736557268afd3.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/fd3/86ff9d2231d1187dadd736557268afd3.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/fd3/86ff9d2231d1187dadd736557268afd3.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}}],"overall_rating":{"review":{"score":2.9,"scale":5}},"total_review_count":6},

He also gave the owners number for me to speak to.People sitting on the other 2 tables also fought nd left in anger.A complete spoiler of our evening.Not at all recommended ","locale":"en-IN"},"score":1,"user":{"first_name,":"Ria","profile_name":"Ria Jacob","last_initial":"Jacob","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/e75/9777e977844880bfc3ca29b65e0aee75.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/e75/9777e977844880bfc3ca29b65e0aee75.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/e75/9777e977844880bfc3ca29b65e0aee75.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/e75/9777e977844880bfc3ca29b65e0aee75.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"40613523","date_added":"2018-12-16T14:02:56+0530","review":{"text":"Been there for last week dinner, it's family friendly restro, ambiance like cafe, they have two types sitting indoor and outdoor We opted indoor as kids along with us For kids they have few toys as well \ud83d\ude00 About drinks they only servers beers no hard drinks Food tests good we tried chicken banjara kabab chinken tangadi paneer hot pan all tests good Overall having few beers along with Family then it's perfect place \ud83d\udc4d","locale":"en-IN"},"score":4,"user":{"first_name,":"Ajay","profile_name":"Ajay Zende","last_initial":"Zende","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/76d/6d03d50b6859e902d9835f0d69c8c76d.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/76d/6d03d50b6859e902d9835f0d69c8c76d.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/76d/6d03d50b6859e902d9835f0d69c8c76d.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/76d/6d03d50b6859e902d9835f0d69c8c76d.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"40208181","date_added":"2018-11-21T22:15:52+0530","review":{"text":"Food: 3.5 (The taste was good, but the noodles were overcooked) Ambiance & interior: 4 (Pleasant and beautiful) Service: 3 (A bit slow, but that's the way you are assured that the place serves you fresh food) Staff: 4 (Warm and welcoming) Parking & location: 3.5 (Sufficient space for parking but far from the main city)","locale":"en-IN"},"score":3,"user":{"first_name,":"Pooja","profile_name":"Pooja","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/3f0/272c75d87651f74577fcf4a934ab23f0.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/3f0/272c75d87651f74577fcf4a934ab23f0.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/3f0/272c75d87651f74577fcf4a934ab23f0.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/3f0/272c75d87651f74577fcf4a934ab23f0.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"34648400","date_added":"2018-04-15T18:01:25+0530","review":{"text":"Good food and also the owner we went there on my anniversary in February, the day special option was really good.

The meat was tough, extremely chewy and the taste was on a bland side. The Salad was sweet which shouldn't be and couldn't taste any salt in it.

With a small food court at central, you hardly have any good options apart from gelato. We gave this one a try, although. I ordered a paneer manchurian with fried rice. I did not have exact change for the dish. I was taken aback by the owner's attitude , that followed. He said that he wont give me food, If I dont have cash. Still, I offered to pay by card, which by the way they do not accept. Whatever the case, denying food to your customers is certainly harsh and rude. Either keep change, or ask the customers to collect it from you before leaving. I had food with a very spoilt mood, and was certainly not pleased wit any of their preparations.

Veg crispy was ok but it got soft by the time it was delivered and very big pieces of vegetables in it. When we called them to give feedback manager mentioned that order was switched by mistake. Some other order came to us but I know he lied because who on this earth will order a mix veg and will ask to remove all vegetables other than cauliflower. Last time also when I ordered chicken handi it had 3 big pieces and which were so chewy ones. Quality has dropped as compared to prior experience.

way from Nasik to Pune made a halt here for lunch. Ambiance: Ample parking space for car. Welcoming entry and neat and clean restaurant. Comfortable seating. Service: Trained and friendly staff. Food: we ordered veg clear soup, tava vegetable, Misi roti and bhakri. Food was good. Soup tasted perfect but found a hair in the soup which was a let down. Cost: Not very cheap but decent. Overall a nice place to stop by for your meal.

There is ample parking space cars and the place is also very good for family dinings. Rates are decent and they also serve alcohol that too without peg system which is cost saving. Good Non-Veg menu and decent quantities of servings. Staff is very good and there is nothing more you could ask for an area where this restaurant belongs.

Following this they then told me I may as well have my money back as it would take 30mins at least to cook another box of noodles. When u have to wait as long as u usually do just to cook one box of noodles it's done it's dash for me.

I was also expecting the egg to be runny by it was hard boiled.","locale":"en-AU"},"score":3,"user":{"first_name,":"SouthEastEater","profile_name":"SouthEastEater","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/9c8/056a9e594aa4076ef94c632f2a5db9c8.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/9c8/056a9e594aa4076ef94c632f2a5db9c8.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/9c8/056a9e594aa4076ef94c632f2a5db9c8.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/9c8/056a9e594aa4076ef94c632f2a5db9c8.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"48177589","date_added":"2020-02-19T19:32:19+1030","review":{"text":"I've been here a few times for karaoke and board games.

We sat in a little alcove off to the side of the main room which felt nice and private, although the whole venue had a great relaxed atmosphere with everyone absorbed in their own groups. The main room is for board games which is $15 pp for 3 hours and includes any drink off the menu (ranging from $4-$8). Be aware that this is an alcohol free zone! There is also a heap of private karaoke rooms around the back. We are not board game experts by any means but they seemed to have a good selection of party games like exploding kittens, cards against humanity, heads up, and lots of Catan! Food wise it\u2019s Taiwanese street food with quite an expansive menu covering dumplings, bao, rice bowls and fried food. Food is well priced at about $10-$14 for a single dish and $21-$24 for the fried platters. Drinks are a range of cute milk teas, sparkling sodas and mocktails. Would have no problem eating here again! The only downside is service which was slow and pretty disorganised. Not sure why but they only have one iPad for payment at the front of the store which creates a huge bottleneck of people wanting to pay and leave as well as coming in to get seated. If you keep your expectations about service low and stay patient you will enjoy Marche!","locale":"en-AU"},"score":4,"user":{"first_name,":"Nini","profile_name":"Nini Foodie","last_initial":"Foodie","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/d46/c6ad85686cf2bbcb2c50cd9753ef2d46.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/d46/c6ad85686cf2bbcb2c50cd9753ef2d46.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/d46/c6ad85686cf2bbcb2c50cd9753ef2d46.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/d46/c6ad85686cf2bbcb2c50cd9753ef2d46.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"44521067","date_added":"2019-08-15T10:26:24+0930","review":{"text":"Came here several times and enjoyed it!

What is going on here I thought to myself. After battling with myself about whether I could bothered lining up (cause frankly I was frozen and over winter) I decided to see what all the fuss was about. Surprisingly, despite the millions of the people in there, I was served very quickly and only waited a couple of minutes for my food. I was shocked. What an efficient system they must have. I decided to try the BBQ pulled pork with brown rice and side salad lunch deal for $9.90. This was quite a large portion and I struggled to finish it. The pulled pork was tasty, loved the healthier option of brown rice. The salad however needed some dressing. Too plain for me. Although I suppose you can mix it with the pork. I also noticed they served St Ali coffee so decided to try this. It was ok but not as good as some of the surrounding outlets in Freshwater Place. Based on today's experience, I would come back and try some of the other menu items like soups and salads.

came here after failing to grab a table at our preferred restaurant. It was cold out, what better way to warm yourself up than to have some hearty Korean food. My friend and I shared a couple of dishes. We had their mustard chicken topped with a generous amount of spring onions. The boneless chicken pieces was slightly crisp but the mustard sauce could have been more potent. Served with a side of salad. We also had their sundubu jjigae which at first glance was severely lacking in chilli powder. The other components were fine (wouldn't have minded some enoki mushrooms) but the broth was quite bland without the chilli component. For a place that's called Spicy Korea, I expected much more. I usually find Korean food in general pretty consistent but was slightly disappointed during this visit. It was quite full and perhaps there was a hiccup or two.

The service is great but that\u2019s all. My previous review back in 2016 was a 5/5. But my most recent coffee was one of the worst that I\u2019ve had! Full stop! I asked and paid for a small strong skinny latte. But what I got was a milky flat white that was soo bad I wanted to take it back but I didn\u2019t have time. The cup was soo full the coffee spilt all over my hand as I was standing still! Yep! I understand that the cafe was busy but this was just awful. Overall there are some amazing cafes in the CBD so I\u2019d recommend going elsewhere. May 2016 I've been coming here for ages now. It's always great service and great coffee no matter how busy it gets. I love the fact that they give you a glass of mineral water too. This is my favourite coffee shop in the CBD.","locale":"en-AU"},"score":1,"user":{"first_name,":"Timinmelbourne","profile_name":"Timinmelbourne","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/1e5/74b9d70bdce584f30f26b8d0f8ee11e5.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/1e5/74b9d70bdce584f30f26b8d0f8ee11e5.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/1e5/74b9d70bdce584f30f26b8d0f8ee11e5.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/1e5/74b9d70bdce584f30f26b8d0f8ee11e5.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"45637011","date_added":"2019-10-15T15:34:44+1030","review":{"text":"Ordered cold drip (Mandheling, Indonesia).

I was told that all the tap beers were happy hour beers which was pretty cool. Ahem! So I ordered a Mountain Goat Steam Ale. That\u2019d be $12.20 mate. Sorry I asked for the happy hour beer I said. Yes they\u2019re all happy hour beers on tap. When I finished my beer I went back to the bar and asked a different barman of my beer was actually a happy hour beer. I was given a spiel about how CUB own all the pubs and well this is the city mate, things are more expensive. My ears were bleeding with this! It\u2019s quite sad as I\u2019ve been going to this pub off n on for a long time now. For the record, there\u2019s a lot of pubs and bars with happy hour drinks/beers available in the city.

This is one of the most pro-white bogan places I've ever set foot in (which is kind of funny since Exford Hotel is in the middle of Chinatown). It feels like everyone there is a biker or otherwise tough in some way. When I was there with some friends (I'm Chinese, one of my friends is Indian), we were getting dirty looks from a lot of the other patrons and it was just not a nice feeling. Our white friend didn't care about all the stink eye we were getting but the glares made it very hard for my Indian friend and me to enjoy our drinks or have a carefree conversation. If I were white, I'd probably like the place. The music they play is what I like to listen to (rock, metal, grunge, classic rock, you get the idea) and I would interpret the atmosphere as super down-to-earth, no bull, a bit rough-and-tumble, and if that's your thing, go for it.

Do not ever go there! Shocking especially from such a nice location based in Crown. I sent back an overcooked poached egg and young waitress (Chinese girl) gave an absolute horrible black face and argued back that poached eggs are meant to be overcooked. I mean how hard can it be getting another egg recooked? She did not apologize what so ever and took the plate back to the kitchen without explaining the problem to the chef. I waited for another 15 minutes to realized that she did not ask the kitchen to remake the egg. Had to speak to the manager who call me bluff for saying I left the plate on the counter and left without explaining what was wrong with the food. Pretty dumb thing to say especially when I have already paid for the food and my husband has finished his breakfast by then. Manager tried to give me a form of lecturing the whole time while young waitress was standing behind him fighting back my comments and yelling out that \"I didn't cook the egg\". Well, that pretty much sums up everything about the customer service. Young waitress clearly is incapable of handling customer complains tactfully (or understanding Australian consumer rights) and has caused a big kerfuffle with a paying customer. The manager was as worst not apologizing and having a go at me while allowing the staff to mouth off at the back. The waitress should be let go. This would have never happened in a proper cafe with trained staff especially in Australian hospitality. Big disappointment indeed. Demand for a refund and left.

score 3.75 stars (avge of 2 reviews). J and I had late lunch here at about 2.45pm on Fri 27th Sep. Service was ok. Not huge queues to order, but food took a little while, so at least partially made from scratch. Our food selection was much better this time, but still trying to find the sweet spot. Home made lemon iced tea ($3.00) - Refreshing, a little sweet with rich lemony and mild green tea flavour.\u00a0 Chicken katsu curry on rice (instead of noodles - large $12.90) \u2013 Reasonable amount of crumbed chicken strips, crumb quite well done but chicken moist. Ok sushi rice, lots of curry sauce which was quite nice. Onion, capsicum, 2 pieces large carrot (not too firm). Reasonably filling serve Grilled tofu steak (large $11.50) - 1.5 tofu steaks (were a slightly odd texture), pickled radish, sushi rice, corn, black sesame seeds, nori strips, red onion and very generous amount of crisp mixed lettuce. Overall, a bit dry as all the sweet teriyaki sauce was at the bottom. Matcha waffle cone ($2.50) - Nice crunchy green cone. Soft serve had a pleasant matcha taste and not too sweet. Cheap! Dec 2018. Service nice. Meals a bit of a let-down and at $35.30 didn't seem great value. Lemon iced tea (refreshing). \u00a0Grilled tofu and mushroom bento - Veg croquette > underwhelming. Tofu and mushroom > ok but lacked flavour intensity. Edamame > ok.\u00a0 \u00a0 Tempura fish bento - Crumbed scallop > ok, prob needed some sauce. Yakitori chicken > small but tasty and quite nice.

He also had some scallop ball things but unfortunately they didn't taste or look like scallops. Instead they looked like crapstick meat. My ramen was ok. It was a cheap $9 something ramen. Still not the worst ramen that I have had in the area. The broth didn't contain much flavour. I would like Tokyo Sushi to have a spicy ramen option. The dumplings were pre-cooked and were cold and tasted not very fresh. I would only recommend Tokyo Sushi if you were looking for very cheap ramen.

All the components of the dish worked to give it pop and taste. The presentation as you can see was superb. The duck was next and the cooking techniques were executed perfectly. Presentation again was A1 and it didn\u2019t want to stick the knife in the ruin the work of of perfection. Hand made Iced Vo Vo S gave it a nice Aussie touch at the end.

I ordered a passionfruit mocktail, the wagyu tartare, confit duck and chocolate dessert. The passionfruit mocktail was very sweet and I would probably not order it again next time. The tartare had so many different textures and was a very balanced dish. Although I enjoyed the duck and its' packets of flavour, I would recommend them to have more green vegetables. If I hadn't had a vegetable side dish to go with it, it would have been too heavy and salty. The last dish out of the 3 course meal was my favourite. Chocolate literally \"across the water\" from the other side of the harbour - the ganache melted the chocolate dish, the crumb gave it texture and the chocolate mousse was smooth.\u00a0 The food was exquisite and deserved 5/5 stars. My only concern was that once the sun had set, the inside was very dim. I could not even see the beautifully presented dishes. More lighting would make the dining experience perfect!

When I asked for popular cocktails recommendations she had to read each one from the menu. She didn't actually know the menu at all. You get a 2 hour seating however it took 1 and a half hours for our mains to come and the waitstaff kept saying that the kitchen was busy but other tables that came AFTER we ordered got their food before us. For such a fine establishment this is truly disappointing service. The only thing I enjoyed was the dessert. Very upsetting.

We had arrived with another couple at the same time, and that couple left at least 40 minutes before we did. I was also told that because we were celebrating our anniversary here, we would be provided with a complimentary chocolate anniversary plate. Which we did not receive. After we finished with dessert, we waited about 20 minutes as we waited for our plates to be cleared and to pay the bill. None of that happened so we just went up to pay the bill at the bar.

Don't expect to see it featuring on Instagram any time soon though.","locale":"en-AU"},"score":3,"user":{"first_name,":"The","profile_name":"The RnB Diary","last_initial":"RnB","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/71f/0aee12eea459df17dbe7cc3c8a53471f.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/71f/0aee12eea459df17dbe7cc3c8a53471f.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/71f/0aee12eea459df17dbe7cc3c8a53471f.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/71f/0aee12eea459df17dbe7cc3c8a53471f.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"24918184","date_added":"2015-09-13T19:44:49+0930","review":{"text":"I used to work in the building that joins onto this cafe, and went there once or twice a week. I love this place! There is a bit of a wait for takeaway at lunch time as many workers come here for lunch but it's worth it. Their wraps are huge, and the vegetarian nachos are easily the best nachos I've ever had. They always have a different soup of the day too, I love the minestrone, pumpkin soup and the zucchini and bacon. Perfect for winter. The owner is super nice.

As the director in charge of corporate entertainment for an extremely large and respected Aussie blue-chip company, I was considering the Sydney Tower as a venue for around 50 important overseas clients (or their representatives) when we recently brought them all to Australia for a familiarisation tour. My budget for the four day event was A$1million so I had a few options to choose from. Having never been to the tower restaurant before I assumed it was an iconic Aussie venue that would be perfect for entertaining our guests. Fortunately, reading all your reviews convinced me this would probably have been the worst place to come. I spoke to my boss about it and we both agreed it would probably cause the company irreparable harm. We ended up taking our 50 visitors to one of the high-end hotels, just to be safe. A big pity, though, that something that should be an icon for Australian tourism is so badly managed and reviewed. Please allow me to apologise to all overseas visitors that have had a bad experience at the Sydney Tower - hopefully you appreciate the bad food and poor service does not reflect Australia as a whole. Unfortunately most Sydney residents have no idea just how bad it is because 99% have never been (and never will!).

Pricing generally good fare at these prices, with decidedly average Pizza (average dough and and not so Pizza lamb Pizza), average chips and over-battered and sometimes over cooked fish and chips (no real brown malt vinegar in sight), we are simply looking at \u201cpay per view dining\u201d. The fish platter is good but overpriced at $135 as well. A return to reality and improved basics at decent prices is in order.

Food: I ordered the slow cooked pork pappardelle and my fianc\u00e9e ordered the king prawn salad. My meal was very yummy - pork was flavoursome and tender and the pasta was al dente, just how I like it. The sauce was balanced and sweet and the olives added a good pop of saltiness. Unfortunately my fianc\u00e9es salad was very disappointing. Only 5 prawns in the whole salad which was too few for the $26 price tag. 85% of the bowl was undressed greens without sufficient dressing to coat them. Pomegranate seeds provided some relief but they were nowhere near as sweet as I would have expected. Service: very quick turnaround of the meals after we ordered despite being packed. We were also allowed to bring in our own cake for my grandmother without being charged extra for cakeage which was a bonus. Value: overpriced for what it was. My pasta was $26 and so was the salad. The salad needed more prawns and not just greens. I personally believe that only the best handmade pasta in a fine dining setting should be over $25. Overall Watergrill is a really nice setting with a beautiful view. However, I feel the price tag of the food does not match the quality.

Not because that, we probably keep continuously missing the improvement of this restaurant.\u00a0 We were greeted by the friendly wait-staff when we walked in and one of them led us to the area to have a la cart after we indicated our purpose of dine-in. Then we were showed the offer of early bird specials on a menu so we might as well to follow their promotion to have a hot stone braised beef short rib and a hot stone seafood soup with additional order of an entr\u00e9e of pan-fried dumplings. Honestly, dumplings are only passable but the other two dishes are too outstanding.\u00a0 The beef ribs are slow-cooked to perfection that fall apart from the bone. Turnip pieces absorb all the flavour and they are soft. Glass noodles are extra-surprise. Besides that the seafood soup is made of many seafood with shelled prawns, mussels, half sand crab and squid.

I found this restaurant is always busy with Korean diners. Tried it one night but I could not find any significant competitive power of this restaurant against its competitors; again, a la carte with option of buffet \"all-you-can-eat\". Although they provide a huge spacious dining area, large range of meat varieties for buffet and also charcoal grill, I just found that there are overwhelming supplies of this type of trading strategy.

Located in simultaneously an awkward yet proximal place, Asian Food Paradise is snuggled in an array of stores on a side street just off multiple main roads (and across the lane from a gas station, to boot). As standard looking as it may be (it is nothing that is unique), if approached with an open mind it is quite a wholesome choice. It is more a take-out than anything; there is the presence of tables for people waiting for their order. The waitress there did what she need to do, and was helpful in my order (I paid by EFTPOS, but was under the minimum - a half order of an entree was allowed). When the order was placed, she suggested to sit down - quite courteous. There was not a lot to the interior, it was a small area for takeaway. It did embelish family-orientation. For my order, there was a $7 lunch special menu (with $1 extra for fried rice and $1 for a can of soda with the exception of Coke) of 15 or so dishes. I chose a salt and pepper chicken with fried rice and a half order of spring rolls. The dish was surprisingly spicy, an agreeable temperature and translated pretty well. There could be improvement on the fried rice - it was a bit plain for fried rice and could have had more substance (such as egg, corn etc) and would have suffered if it was eaten by itself. The spring rolls were better than average and I could detect actual ingredients in the filling. Overall, a decent meal for the folk short on time. I have been to Asian Food Paradise several times before, and they have had good food - slightly different from the Chinese and Thai that are common in the situated area. This time, Asian Food Paradise did not disappoint and I will certainly consider returning.","locale":"en-AU"},"score":3.5,"user":{"first_name,":"Atreyu","profile_name":"Atreyu","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/edb/a28f6e6650dee76d518a53e8f2db3edb.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/edb/a28f6e6650dee76d518a53e8f2db3edb.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/edb/a28f6e6650dee76d518a53e8f2db3edb.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/edb/a28f6e6650dee76d518a53e8f2db3edb.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"11168830","date_added":"2012-09-08T15:37:12+0930","review":{"text":"For any newly integrated residents, this would be a good place because of its value; it would also be good for any families of young children and university students (who remembers those days?).

The booking was made for 8 people and confirmed it twice with the staff before arriving. The table that was allocated was not enough to seat 8 adults, I requested the table to be changed and by the time I returned, the table was allocated to someone else although it was reserved for us. I requested the staff for another table, but they directed us to go back and stand in line to talk to reservation staff - which i did.(my family was standing around for about 20 mins until we were served down the line) Then they managed to find another table with high chairs which went not suitable for my older parents/grandparents so we requested a similar table to what we originally had with more room. Then the gentlemen at the pizzeria offered some seating but then other staff eventually asked us to leave as there was a party set up. My family and I had to walk away - we did NOT receive an apology and they did not try to address/rectify the issue. They ruined our birthday plans and very unprofessional approach- they could have spoken to the people who sat on our reserved table but instead kicked us out .

Rather a long wait for our breakfast & we were pretty early so it wasn't ultra busy. When it did arrive coffee & food came together, coffee was haphazardly spilled in both saucers with no offer of a clean up or replacement.

We ordered a kids burger and an adult burger and the portion was exactly the same with an $8 difference, I had a seafood pizza which would have been lovely if it hadn\u2019t been smothered in Marie sauce which ruined it, and really below average calamari from the starter menu with a dry salad and rubbery calamari.

disrespect on the staff members on each other that I have witness yesterday, I question how they train staff. I ordered through front counter and was served by a nice lady yesterday evening/night and the whole time I was ordering another chick kept popping up out of nowhere trying to help the lady who was serving me but at the end, she read back all my order correctly. While I was waiting for my order I kept noticing the same chick popping up out of nowhere and that every time she 'tries' to help the front counter lady most orders came out wrong and most customers were furious including myself because somehow my order was completely wrong. and the manager at the time was no help at all! and made it even worse. There could've been ways to solve whatever was going on. like maybe swapping the packer and the till person. or just maybe not be so unprofessional in-front of customers. The behaviour shown between co-workers yesterday is disgusting and it was such eye sore to watch a coworker visibly being nasty to another co-worker. My advice is to do your job correctly and to communicate as a team because I did not see that at all yesterday.","locale":"en-AU"},"score":1,"user":{"first_name,":"Siva","profile_name":"Siva Onalei","last_initial":"Onalei","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/4e9/682e23c88510419df162c3b71737f4e9.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/4e9/682e23c88510419df162c3b71737f4e9.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/4e9/682e23c88510419df162c3b71737f4e9.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/4e9/682e23c88510419df162c3b71737f4e9.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"12082192","date_added":"2013-03-17T02:08:37+1030","review":{"text":"This is NOT North Lakes.

We have always enjoyed the meals and friendliness of the owner and staff. Even though the restaurant is mostly quiet(how we like it) the take-away section of Willow Garden is consistently busy, maybe explaining some of the waiting time in the restaurant mentioned by another reviewer. They need to realize that, even though there are only a few tables occupied, the kitchen staff are cooking for another 20 tables via take-away. The Chinese art and decor on display is impressive and that hint of the 70's in the bar decor just adds to the atmosphere.

We went to Willow Garden for a family birthday dinner. There was six of us and only one other occupied table in the restaurant, yet somehow it took over an hour for all our mains to be brought out. By the time my egg noodles came, everyone else had finished their food. The wait staff did not check up on us, so if we wanted to order a drink we had to walk up to the cash register and wait to be attended. The drink never came, so we had to ask again twenty minutes later. We ordered four fried ice creams to follow our meals, but they never came. Everyone else had left the restaurant and we were still there waiting for food as the staff were mopping the floors out the front. By then we'd been there for two hours. We tried to find someone to ask about the progress of the order, but were told it was \"coming\". It had been about 40 minutes since we finished our meals when we asked for a second time about the order, and the waitress informed us that they had forgotten about it. Argh! When we went to pay, there was an added charge on our bill. It turned out that instead of bringing us the entree for four that we had ordered (two people in our group of 6 were vego), they had brought us an entree for six and thus doubled the price. The woman behind the counter refused to change the amount. We were already aggravated after waiting so long for food and drinks that never came. It ruined the occasion and left us all feeling unfulfilled and annoyed. How can you have such sloppy service when there's only one table you have to look after?

Malaysian hawker food We visited Dapur Dahlia at their now not so new premises opposite the Buranda shopping centre for lunch on Sunday - which are a huge step up from their old premises at Mount Gravatt. Unfortunately no roti was available so we tried the dry curry mee with chicken, seafood laksa lemak, fried chicken and a taro pudding for dessert. The dry curry mee was very good but we weren't that impressed with the laksa - it had a more buttery rather than coconut milk flavour and they used short fat rice noodles (\"mouse tail\" noodles) which are not our favourite. The food here is Malay style rather than Chinese Malaysian style so I don't think that this is the place to eat noodles. We're going to come back and try the nasi lemak (which looked amazing) and some roti! They have a good coffee machine and use Wolff Coffee which was excellent.","locale":"en-AU"},"score":4,"user":{"first_name,":"Suzie","profile_name":"Suzie Lee","last_initial":"Lee","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/7f4/59cab673655642a079fb5e777fbb37f4.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/7f4/59cab673655642a079fb5e777fbb37f4.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/7f4/59cab673655642a079fb5e777fbb37f4.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/7f4/59cab673655642a079fb5e777fbb37f4.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"43332765","date_added":"2019-06-01T22:23:37+0930","review":{"text":"There are many Malaysian Chinese restaurants around Brisbane. My 600th food review is on this Malaysian Malay restaurant. I feel welcome as I walk up to the counter. The smiling Manager is happy to explain the menu to me as I place my order and pay at the counter. *Chicken Satay ($12) has four Chicken Skewers served with a Satay Peanut Sauce and several slices of raw onion and cucumber. Ketupat (compressed rice) is available for $2. These Chicken Skewers are grilled under an electric stove as charcoal grilling is banned. The Chicken is nicely marinated, tasty and tender. Dipped in the Satay Sauce, this is a delicious entree. Highly recommended! Many restaurants deep fry their Satay Skewers to save time. This is blasphemy and an unheard of practice in Malaysia. Rating: 4.5 *Nasi Lemak with Beef Rendang ($13) comes with steamed rice, half boiled egg, Sambal, Peanuts and Fried Anchovies. I was disappointed coconut rice was not served. The Beef Rendang and Sambal is delicious but the overall serving is small compared to Papparich, Taste of Penang, Sri Makhota, Malaya Corner and Singapore & Co. Rating: 4 * Kuih Lapis (3 for $5) is left uncovered in the refrigerated cabinet. Hence, the top layer is hard and inedible while the rest of the Kuih tastes quite average. Not recommended. Rating: 3 This restaurant has an interesting Malay Menu. I will return with my family to try some traditional Malay dishes.

They might have changed the location because I found the venue is different from last time but more spacious and modernised.\u00a0 Incidentally, I was back from Penang prior to the exploration so found that the way that they prepared the Malaysian dishes was different from what I had in Malaysia. Having said that it does not mean that they are not authentic. Portions were still not generous as before but very tasteful; particularly the satay sauce. We has the dinner at mid-March with voucher deal, otherwise we might paid over-prices there. \u00a0 Rating 3.5/5\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Aug 09, 2014\u00a0 Rating 3/5\u00a0 Authentic or valuable?. Have tried the Satay Ayam, Ayam Goreng, Seafood Laksa and Seafood Mee Goreng. Feeling is so so. \u00a0 One thing that wouldn't score the 'like' is the small portion that they served. Being a Malaysian restaurant, it is definitely fair to provide authentic Malaysian food, however, customers always would like to have larger portion for value and appetite particular when the food is yummy. \u00a0 Char-grilled Chicken satay just done perfect with nice sweet satay sauce, however, the Ayam Goreng (Fried chicken wing) was dry and tasteless. Mee Goreng only comes with two small pieces of prawn and some half-cut fish balls and the noodle was too hard (seems under-cooked). The seafood Laksa was done with different types of noodles than other Malyasian restaurants, which may due to the fact that the chef is originated from different part of Malaysia but the Laksa did not give me the usual taste, not to mention the one that I had in Malaysia at KL & Ipoh. General impression, I prefer Little Singapore or Satay Ria.","locale":"en-AU"},"score":3,"user":{"first_name,":"Ronnielui2003","profile_name":"Ronnielui2003","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/user_avatars/pizza_2x.png?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/user_avatars/pizza_2x.png?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/user_avatars/pizza_2x.png?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/user_avatars/pizza_2x.png?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"40889721","date_added":"2019-01-23T10:30:56+1030","review":{"text":"Malaysian food is known for its diversity as we are a multicultural country and Dapur Dahlia specialises more in Malay style Malaysian food rather than the chinese version.

The ambience was nice and welcoming. My fiance ordered nasi lemak with beef rendang, while I ordered their special of the day which was beef, chicken and fish ball soup with noodles. We also ordered teh tarik and sardine karipap. There were 2 other tables occupied whom hadn't got their food, so understandably there was quite a wait for ours. Our sardine karipap came first, followed by my fiance's nasi lemak shortly after. I watched on as one by one the dishes for the other tables came out. Eventually everyone in the restaurant was eating, apart from me. At this point, my fiance had already finished 3 quarters of his meal. I asked the waitress about my soup and she said that the kitchen had forgotten about my order as there were only 2 cooks in the kitchen (not sure how this poses a challenge). I do not understand what was so difficult about putting together a bowl of soup (the stock/broth should already been boiling away in a pot), just had to throw in the noodles and meatballs! When the soup finally came, I had lost my appetite as I was very unhappy. The vermicelli noodles looked sad, there were only 6 tiny meatballs. The soup was overpowering with white pepper. It was obviously put together in a rush without any attention to detail. If we hadn't paid beforehand I seriously considered walking out. I voiced my dissatisfaction, the waitress apologised and offered 2 slices of kuih seri muka as compensation. At least there was some customer service provided. If the restaurant was jam packed and service was busy, I can understand that it would be easy to forget an order; but this was on a rainy Sunday, with only 3 tables to serve. What was the most frustrating part? That the manager(?) was sitting not far from us typing away on his laptop, and he did not try to rectify the situation. Very disappointed.

The first look at the shop from the parking made us hesitate whether we should step in or go somewhere else. The place looked very tiny, cheap and unwelcoming. There was only a table of 4 people and a couple of people waiting for their takeaway. We seated ourselves inside and instantly a guy (wearing very casual) brought us menus. He was very friendly and talkative. He started very well with introducing specials of the night; unfortunately, he couldn't explain what they actually were. I googled some images by using the names of those food, and ordered one of the specials. The special was disappointing- all deep fried stuff that tasted like kept overnight in the fridge and over reheated and served with peanut sauce that overwhelmed with sweetness. Our second dish was Roti Jala which was crepes served with chicken curry. The crepes were quite interesting, but the curry was cold and as shown in the photo there were only few pieces of chicken. For mains, I had Laksa with seafood. Hmmm it was quite flavoursome though the soup was way too rich. My partner had Makki Goreng with chicken, and he was quite happy with it.

Ordered the Aussie Parmigiana, which consisted of crispy and moist chicken schnitzel with a slice of ham and melted cheese. Simple and filling to eat. The accompanying sauce, however, was overly sweet. Service was friendly and reasonably efficient. Casual ambience with indoor and outdoor seating available. Reasonable prices. Overall, a casual and average lunch option whilst shopping at Brisbane Airport DFO.","locale":"en-AU"},"score":3,"user":{"first_name,":"Quesarahsarah","profile_name":"Quesarahsarah","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/5b6/f70cfb26584f56f5e9e0d34f03ea15b6.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/5b6/f70cfb26584f56f5e9e0d34f03ea15b6.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/5b6/f70cfb26584f56f5e9e0d34f03ea15b6.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/5b6/f70cfb26584f56f5e9e0d34f03ea15b6.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"45289886","date_added":"2019-09-26T17:25:17+0930","review":{"text":"Disappointing.

We entered the store from the front (side entrance available) and the barista instantly acknowledged us and asked us to take a seat. We sat at a table against the wall, plates were left there from a previous diner but there wasn't a better seating area (most available was under ceiling fans and I was feeling a little cold). We were starving, I had previously been to a fasting blood test which took 3 hours and by this point I could eat a horse (not literally)! After waiting a good 5-10 mins for a waitstaff and menus, my husband approached the counter to ask/ grab some menus so that we could order straight away when a staff member was available. The barista said, \"take a seat and we'll bring it to you\", my husband insisted on a menu but the barista again said we'll bring it to you. there were 2 female waitstaff serving tables and 1 male waitstaff serving drinks and taking takeaway orders. Another 10mins went by and we were ready to walk out! Staff were just chatting to each other at one point and finally when a waitstaff had to serve drinks to the table next to us we \"waved her down\", by saying \"excuse me\". And she instantly said I'll come and clear your table. We replied, and asked for menus. She took our drinks order and soon after we had to wave another staff down to place an order. We ordered the Salmon & Avo Stack, Bacon, Eggs & Tomato and a side of chips. Why the random chips? I had cravings for deep fried potatoes and was going to opt for the hash brown but at $3 a pop and wanting more than 1, I thought I'd get more potatoes for the side of chips at $7.90! The food came after 15-20mins and by this point I was starving! It tasted good (or I was just so hungry everything tasted good)! The bacon was a little oily but otherwise a decent serving size.

Anyway, I found myself at Shingle Inn a few weeks back on my Friday off and decided to enjoy a late brunch there. \u00a0A mug of flat white and a bacon and egg wrap with a hash brown included in the wrap (you can have it as a side or inside the wrap) were my order and both were delicious. \u00a0I have to say the coffee here is always good - great flavour, nice and hot, not too bitter. \u00a0And the wrap was good - I usually have the hash brown on the side - so being a little adventurous was great and I really like the inclusion.

I popped into the store one week prior, to reconfirm the booking and told the staff again about the corner booth which they reconfirmed was reserved for me. On Mothers Day when we arrived the owner told me he had given the corner booth to a walk-in customer and that we could have the bench seats instead!

Such a cool restaurant with really friendly staff and delicious food. You can tell that The Burrow has a real sense of originality by its atmosphere but also how they make everything on their menu in house like the dips and the burger patties. It was really hard for me to choose only two things from the menu because all their vegan options looked so yummy! The pizza that I had was gone too quickly because it was just too good, crispy crust and flavourful topping, should of ordered a bigger one! The dips that we ordered tasted very flavourful and you could tell that the chefs takepride in what they make and how they make things. Will definitely be ordering some of these dips for my birthday! Overall this place has got to be one of my go to restaurants in Brisbane now that I have tried only a fraction of their amazing vegan food options. I went during lunch time so I look forward to go there for dinner and seeing the place buzzing!

I was craving pasta tonight and nothing else would suffice so I did a quick search on Google and came across this place literally 5 minutes drive from home. After reading a few reviews on how great the pizza was I thought I'd give the place a go. I'm so glad I did! I've found it near impossible to find decent pasta (especially takeaway) anywhere in Brisbane. So stoked I found this little gem so close to home! Would have given a 5 if it wasn't for the wait to get my food, but it was totally worth it and the staff were very friendly. Will be back very soon. Second visit. We ate in this time. We ordered the lamb pizza which was devine, and a small between the two of us was the perfect amount for an entree. For mains I ordered the seafood fettuccine. After asking what seafood was in it and being advised it had muscles I was going to change my selection, but the owner said he could make it without muscle which I appreciate as alot of places wont do that. My partner ordered the mushroom & blue cheese penne. Both were beautiful. Pasta cooked perfectly and both sauces were rich and super tasty. The meals came out super quick this time too.

A couple of months ago around june my partner and i on holidays decided to give this hotel a try as it was not far from our hotel but what a huge mistake this was, we arrived around 6.40m and decided to ordered some food from the menu that looked really great as we waited my partner and i dec@ided to play 20 dollars in the pokies. After a hour i asked the lovley girl behind the bar if the meals would be ready soon, she went to check. As it turned out our order had somhow got lost between the casheir and the kitchen she apologised and got her manager by now its almost 9and the manager who was a tall ,older ladie with dark hair and a was very rude and snaped that the kitchen is not taking any more orders and she did not care that we had ordered and paid at for our meals. She called my partner a smartass when he asked for a refund for the meal we did not receive. She was very aggressive and angry over a problem that could have been handled in a more professional way. She also called us snobs and asked us to leave. Its the worst experience ive ever encounted. She should not work or especially manage@ a hotel at any hour when you must engage with people in a hospitable way. I will tell everyone to avoid this crown hotel at lutwyche from now on, i hope the day manager has more tact and a ability to deal and talk to customers.

From the outside, this place really lacks curb appeal. It needs a refresh because it's actually got great food! Inside is better but still a little dull. We ordered lunch and it came quickly. I had the pulled pork burger which was tasty - really good soft bun and a generous amount of pork. Pork wasn't the best I've ever had but still tasty. The chips were really crispy and yum and a great aioli dipping sauce. My husband had the steak sandwich which he really enjoyed (and the man is a steak sandwich lover). There are plenty of drinks to choose from (not a lot of great craft beer though) and wine specials for $5 a glass are always welcome. The food isn't totally amazing but my score is based on value for money and judging it for what it is. A bit of a refresh and this place would be a great local that I'd visit again.","locale":"en-AU"},"score":4,"user":{"first_name,":"Lifelovetravelfood","profile_name":"Lifelovetravelfood","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/3cf/7c1905f4a6af5f86c5970c9b21c503cf.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/3cf/7c1905f4a6af5f86c5970c9b21c503cf.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/3cf/7c1905f4a6af5f86c5970c9b21c503cf.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/3cf/7c1905f4a6af5f86c5970c9b21c503cf.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"27396264","date_added":"2016-06-18T14:24:10+0930","review":{"text":"Incredibly underrated - still haven't had a bad meal.

Pathetic. Its the best i have to say. Marginal food at the best of times. The new moron of a manager has recently decided to leave all the doors open not only rendering the air con useless on a hot day but also as the front door is on a very busy road so there is traffic noise through the entire establishment. Absolute genius. To add insult to this we were still planning to do a Christmas lunch as it is our local and in spite of a printed menu and numerous conversations plus a firm booking we turn up only to find the place all closed up. We were not the only ones. Very professional. A phone call was not possible it seems as they are too busy and important to care about customers. Well that has fixed us we will not be back.

Food, for the most part is good. I don't want to write a negative review about the menu or the food, or even the people. I've had one negative experience out of many, but it's enough to discourage me from returning again. I ordered a takeaway vegetarian pizza, walked the two streets home and took a bite. I realised that it was covered in pesto and being allergic to most nuts, started vomiting. I called the Crown Hotel to explain what had happened and asked that if I brought it back, would I be able to get one without the pesto, as I'm allergic to nuts. The person on the phone hesitantly said \"okay\". I got to the hotel and sat down near the bar where I originally ordered the pizza. A man who I presume to be the manager came out and asked me if I ordered the pizza. I responded yes and handed him the full box with one piece of the original pizza missing and said \"I'm sorry, it seems like such a waste\". To my surprise, the man grunted and said \"you know, normally you would have to pay for another one. It says on the menu that it has nuts\" I explained that I hadn't seen the menu and had simply asked if they had any vegetarian pizzas. He showed me the menu and it did say that it contained 'pesto mayo', but no mention of any nuts. Now, I understand that it was my mistake for not looking at the menu or asking the wait staff if it contained any nuts, my reason for this is because my allergy is mild, and not anaphylactic, so my life is not at risk if I consume nuts. My shock comes from the way it was handled. I was not rude or demanding on the phone, I made no demands, I only asked, I didn't argue, I didn't scold them. Yet I was met with the attitudes that I was trying to rip them off or act shady with one piece of my pizza was eaten. If I pay $17.00 for a pizza, I'm going to damn well get something that I can digest. If I was dining in and something was wrong with my meal, I'm sure I wouldn't have been met with the rudeness and attitude that I was tonight. Once again, to reiterate: the bar/wait staff are wonderful, the venue is nice, the food tastes good, there's never anybody there, but apparently the manager is a wanker.","locale":"en-AU"},"score":0,"user":{"first_name,":"Brad","profile_name":"Brad","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/user_avatars/cupcake.png?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/user_avatars/cupcake.png?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/user_avatars/cupcake.png?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/user_avatars/cupcake.png?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"12083644","date_added":"2012-12-16T06:04:18+1030","review":{"text":"Diana. Thought we would go out of our comfort zone & try pub grub for a change at The Crown which looks good after the reno (dont know when that was incidently) We had a voucher deal for this adventure into the burbs which included a glass of wine & $10 pokie credit entre & mains. The entre was pretty basic fare, an asian tasting plate, which seemed to me like was frozen & fried (like those mixed bags in the supermarket freezers) The brushetta bread we had was quite good (maybe the best dish of the night!) For the mains we had two fish dishes, I had the grilled fish with salad & beer battered fries which was not bad apart from the one piece of fish being a bit rubbery, the partner had a mixed selection which he too thought was OK. The charming waiter who served the food was just so sweet, but the best part of the night was when we went to use our gaming credit & a rude woman got stroppy when I accidently sat in her chair, evidently this poker machine stuff is taken very seriously so if you happen to go to the Crown do not nick someones seat!

I'd like to think that I had a one-off experience. I can't however, share the same level of enthusiasm for Bun that others seem to display. I \"get\" that the Mantou style steamed bun might be a novelty for some but it's not anything new. I appreciate the mixing of food styles might cause some excitement too. I ordered the chicken and I can tell you it was like \"that\" picture of food where the photo gets you excited and the actual product leaves a lot to be desired. When working with flavours like Bun do, less is more. All I tasted was Mantou bun, a piece of chicken (not cooked very well) and Hoi Sin sauce accompanied with some shavings of cabbage, a strand of carrot a little else. It was put together very badly and the construct of flavours was completely overpowered by Hoi Sin sauce. I am sure Bun are doing something right but as a complete fan of Asian flavours I am getting a little tired of \"near enough is good enough\" being peddled as something \"unique\". All in all, a completely poor experience and 10.00 for what I ate amounts to robbery!

I was interested in their chinese cake. It was written that the cake had coconut and rice cake fillings. Since I love rice cake, so I didnt mind giving it a try. The outer part of the cake was crunchy. It was similar as puff pastry. The inner part was moist, chewy and soft. It was the rice cake which gave such texture. It tasted just right, not too sweet so I could enjoy it. It was good and cheap as well. 2.40$ for one cake. However I couldnt taste the coconut, (I expected to taste the shredded coconut along with the rice cake as the filling) I wasnt sure if it was supposed to be two kinds of chinese cake with different filling or one chinese cake with a filling of combination of coconut and rice cake.

disappointing experience. I had heard so much about this place and was really expecting to like it. We had a booking for 7:45, and the table that we were eventually sat at was empty from the time we arrived. We however had to wait until 8:20 before we were seated. While we waited at the bar, we ordered French martini\u2019s. The cocktails were extremely watered down with pineapple juice and were very disappointing for the price. The bar staff were generally not very friendly either. At dinner, we were never given 2 of the dishes we ordered, but did not realise until we had already gone home. Service was pretty non existent all night. The food we did receive was good, but not good enough to make up for everything else. I was just pretty disappointed with the whole experience. Considering that this place is not cheap and there are several other amazing, high end restaurants across the road, I expected better.","locale":"en-AU"},"score":2,"user":{"first_name,":"Andrea","profile_name":"Andrea","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/user_avatars/mug_2x.png?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/user_avatars/mug_2x.png?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/user_avatars/mug_2x.png?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/user_avatars/mug_2x.png?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"40934218","date_added":"2019-01-06T08:09:16+1030","review":{"text":"Bucci has long been a family favourite & today just reaffirmed why. Few Italian restaurants can provide authentic food and flavours, with a modern, refreshing twist. Bucci is one that can and does - consistently.

We were a little late getting in, so by the time we were seated several antipasto platters were already on the table, and the staff were quick to take ours drinks orders. There were some language barriers with one of our waiters, but he was patient with us and our drinks were brought out promptly. The antipasto platters were excellent, with just enough of everything that everybody could have a couple of bites with our drinks while we waited for mains. I had the Bucci Angolotti while my wife had the Tagliatelle Con Cicale Di Mare. While both were wonderful, my wife's gluten free replacement option for tagliatelle was box penne which was a little disappointing. For dessert we both had the Chocolate Nemesis Del \"The River Cafe\". What came out was a piece of cake that is taste and texture was very much like a well made brownie. I loved it immensely for it's flavor and texture and how well it went with the mascarpone. One comment made by several people at our table was that there was a tendancy for the waitstaff to hover. Attentive service is always appreciated, but it seemed like a fork or a glass couldn't be put down without somebody appearing behind us. The few cocktails we had were excellent as well. I would recommend the Amaretto Sour to anybody that way inclined, and the spirits list, while not extensive, has plenty of mid and high range options to keep spirit heads happy. The only major issue was paying. There were some drinks missing off the bill and items appearing not to be paid for when they had. It was sorted out in the end but it made the end of the night a bit of a mess. Overall though the food is lovely, the vibe is good, and the drinks are great. Happy to have been a patron to all three.","locale":"en-AU"},"score":3.5,"user":{"first_name,":"Joshua","profile_name":"Joshua Yates","last_initial":"Yates","photo_sizes":{"thumbnail":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/4b3/f9abd096294458c9fda9a787a86fd4b3.jpg?fit=around%7C200%3A200&crop=200%3A200%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":200,"pixel_width":200},"small":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/4b3/f9abd096294458c9fda9a787a86fd4b3.jpg?fit=around%7C240%3A240&crop=240%3A240%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":240,"pixel_width":240},"large":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/4b3/f9abd096294458c9fda9a787a86fd4b3.jpg?fit=around%7C520%3A520&crop=520%3A520%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":520,"pixel_width":520},"medium":{"url":"https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/4b3/f9abd096294458c9fda9a787a86fd4b3.jpg?fit=around%7C320%3A320&crop=320%3A320%3B%2A%2C%2A","pixel_height":320,"pixel_width":320}}}},{"id":"32107430","date_added":"2017-10-19T12:32:15+1030","review":{"text":"Came here last night for a glass of wine and dessert with my girlfriends.
